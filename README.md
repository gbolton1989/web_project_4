# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Overview

A page where users can edit their profile info and add new places they have pictures of, made possible by the use of Javascript and a popup box. This also has multiple uses of various HTML and CSS techniques to add a user profile as well as a grid element to show off various photos of someone's journey.

I added more JS functionality to add new place elements as well as being able to like and delete place elements as well. 

I also fixed all issues that came up in the code review.
