# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Overview

A page where users can edit their profile info and add new places they have pictures of, made possible by the use of Javascript and a popup box. This also has multiple uses of various HTML and CSS techniques to add a user profile as well as a grid element to show off various photos of someone's journey.

I added more JS functionality to add new place elements as well as being able to like and delete place elements as well. 

###Project 6 Updates

Form validation has been added to all forms as well as the ability to exit out of the forms by either hitting the ESC key or clicking anywhere outside of the form.
